* build an app

** loaded: true

   flag to determine if the data is loaded, or if your app needs to
   think about things for a while, it doesn't look like your app is
   hung up. (Could show a spinner, etc.)

** React.DOM

   React creates raw DOM, which you can call directly.

   Most people who think of ReactJS as a platform are using the DOM
   functions. Otherwise, and probably easier, is to use JSX
   transpiler.
